# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## December 2022: New in preview only

### People and workplace intelligence | Item insights
A user whose item insights have been disabled can still see the file-based activities of other users with item insights enabled. Previous to this update, that user with item insights disabled would not see anybody's trending content. Learn more about [an organization's insights-based experience after disabling a user's item insights](item-insights-overview.md#disable-or-re-enable-item-insights).

## November 2022: New and generally available

### Education
- [Create](/graph/api/educationassignment-setupfeedbackresourcesfolder) a SharePoint folder for an [assignment](/graph/api/resources/educationassignment) to upload feedback documents.
- [Create](/graph/api/educationfeedbackresourceoutcome-post-outcomes) a [feedback document](/graph/api/resources/educationFeedbackResourceOutcome) for a [submission](/graph/api/resources/educationsubmission) in the feedback folder associated with the assignment.

- Only the tenant admin of the sender of a [chat message](/graph/api/resources/chatmessage) can [update](/graph/api/chatmessage-update) and override a [policy violation](/graph/api/resources/chatmessagepolicyviolation) on the message. Usually, a data loss prevention (DLP) application takes action when a sender violates policy and sends data they should not send. 
- [Send activity feed notifications](teams-send-activityfeednotifications.md) to a user, to a user in a chat, or to a user in a team, based on the supported types of [activities](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#activities) declared in the corresponding app manifest.

### Applications
- Enable or disable the [lock configuration of sensitive properties](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipallockconfiguration?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) of a multi-tenant [application](/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for editing after the application is provisioned in a tenant.

With proper permissions, the app can create a [browser site list](/graph/api/resources/browsersitelist?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), add a [browser site](/graph/api/resources/browsersite?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and [shared cookie](/graph/api/resources/browsersharedcookie?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), and [publish](/graph/api/browsersitelist-publish?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the site list for Microsoft Edge to download.
